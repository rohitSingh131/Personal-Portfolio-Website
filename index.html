            <h5>HTML/CSS Design</h5>
            <p>
              Every website should be build two primary goals: Firstly, it needs
              to work across all devices. Secondly, it needs to be fastest as
              possible.HTML and CSS are the foundational skills required for most 
              jobs in the tech sector. These are pretty basic and each job description 
              of a front end developer will have these as a requirement. HTML and CSS are 
              like the ABCs of front end development, necessary to learn the language of 
              website development.
              HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language which is 
              used to create web pages. For website development, HTML is a critical skill. 
              Therefore, it is a basic requirement for a front end developer.
              CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to make a digital document 
              alive and communicable. A web page is created with HTML first and then CSS is 
              used to put elements such as layout, format, colour, fonts etc on the page. It 
              makes the web page interactive and presentable. you create with HTML.
              Both HTML and CSS are definitely the skills no front end developer can do without!

              Another must-have skill for any front end developer is JavaScript (JS). 
              Where HTML is a markup language and CSS enhances the web page, Javascript 
              is a programming language that makes the website functional.
              HTML and CSS are used to make websites that look fairly simple but most 
              websites today are expected to have enhanced interactive features such 
              as audio, video, animations etc. In such cases, Javascript comes in handy.

            <h5>REACTJS</h5>
            <p>
              React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for 
              building user interfaces. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based 
              front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. 
              React is used to create modular user interfaces. It promotes the 
              development of reusable UI components that display dynamic data.
              React uses a declarative paradigm, react application aims to be both 
              efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in 
              your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the 
              right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your 
              code more predictable and easier to debug. A React application is made 
              of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a small, reusable 
              piece of HTML. Components can be nested within other components to allow 
              complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks. A 
              component may also maintain an internal state – for example, a TabList 
              component may store a variable corresponding to the currently open tab.
              Let us understand this with a practical example:
              Let’s say one of your friends posted a photograph on Facebook. Now you 
              go and like the image and then you started checking out the comments too. 
              Now while you are browsing over comments you see that the likes count 
              has increased by 100, since you liked the picture, even without 
              reloading the page. This magical count change is because of ReactJS

          <h2>01. HTML/CSS</h2>
          <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language which 
          is used to create web pages. For website development, HTML is a critical
          skill. Therefore, it is a basic requirement for a front end developer.
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to make a digital 
          document alive and communicable. A web page is created with HTML first 
          and then CSS is used to put elements such as layout, format, colour, 
          fonts etc on the page. It makes the web page interactive and presentable. 
          you create with HTML.</p>

        <div class="notpersonal">
          <h2>02. RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h2>
          <p>Today, websites are not simply viewed on desktops but across other devices, 
          such as tablets, phones etc. A good website is one that offers suitable 
          viewing experience across all devices. This is essentially a responsive 
          website. Another must-have skill for any front end developer is to be able 
          to create websites that are responsive using design elements as well as 
          coding.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="personal">
          <h2>03. CSS PREPROCESSING</h2>
          <p>CSS as a stand alone skill may not be as beneficial for career growth and 
          for attaining versatility in your portfolio. One of the drawbacks of only
          using CSS is that you can’t define variables, functions, or perform 
          arithmetic operations.
          When a project grows or becomes more complex, using just CSS may become 
          redundant and repetitive as codes will have to be written every time, 
          which is time-consuming. CSS Preprocessing takes care of this limitation 
          and any smart front end developer would definitely want this skill in 
          his/her toolkit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notpersonal">
          <h2>04. JAVASCRIPT</h2>
          <p>Another must-have skill for any front end developer is JavaScript (JS). 
          Where HTML is a markup language and CSS enhances the web page, Javascript 
          is a programming language that makes the website functional.
          HTML and CSS are used to make websites that look fairly simple but most 
          websites today are expected to have enhanced interactive features such as 
          audio, video, animations etc. In such cases, Javascript comes in handy.          
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="personal">
          <h2>05. CSS AND JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS</h2>
          <p>While we have talked about CSS and Javascript, their frameworks can be 
            considered an upskill from that. These frameworks are bundles of CSS or 
            JS files that provide added functionality to a website.
            A good front end developer needs to gauge the pros and cons of the 
            frameworks being considered for instance some frameworks help make 
            searching content easier while some are good at displaying content more 
            effectively. Whatever be the case, to excel at front end development, 
            knowledge of these frameworks is a must.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notpersonal">
          <h2>04. VERSION CONTROL/GIT</h2>
          <p>This is an important time-saving skill and also helps a front end 
            developer deliver a customised product. Throughout the project development, 
            many unforeseen changes or errors might come along. Version control helps 
            in fixing the errors or making the necessary changes without having to 
            start over from scratch.
            Though it doesn’t need to be made explicitly clear this is a critically 
            helpful skill to have for any front end developer.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="personal">
          <h2>05. TESTING/DEBUGGING</h2>
          <p>A very important aspect of website development is to make sure that the 
            end result is error-free, free of bugs and seamless experience for the user. 
            Therefore, the ability to test and debug a website is another essential 
            skill set any front end developer needs to have. There are various methodologies 
            that can enable the front end developer to make sure that the website or product 
            not only looks good but also functions smoothly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notpersonal">
          <h2>06. WEB PERFORMANCE</h2>
          <p>By now, you must have understood that HTML, CSS and Javascript are the foundational 
            skills required by all front end developers. The other skills that have been 
            listed are basically required to make sure that the website or product you are 
            building is efficient, error-free, interactive and easy to use. Web performance 
            is a skillset that makes sure that the user experience is excellent. It is basically
            the loading time of your website. Naturally, if it is too slow, the users won’t 
            be happy with the experience. As front end developers, you would be expected 
            to have knowledge of how to use building and automation tools that enhance web performance.

        <div class="personal">
          <h2>07. REACT.JS</h2>
          <p>Being a part of the JavaScript language, using React spawns lots of advantages. 
            Products built with React are simple to scale, a single language used on the 
            server/client/mobile side of things grants outstanding productivity, there are 
            workflow patterns for convenient teamwork, UI code is readable and maintainable, 
            and more. World-leading companies have used React and other JS technologies in 
            some of the top market-defining products out there (Instagram, Reddit, and 
            Facebook being the most vivid examples).</p>
